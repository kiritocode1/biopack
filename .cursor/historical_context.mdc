# Historical Context

## [2025-11-25]
### Switched to White Mode
- Inverted global CSS variables in `app/globals.css` to support light mode by default.
    - `--background` set to `#f4fbfe` (light).
    - `--foreground` set to `#050e05` (dark).
    - Swapped `--color-bio-dark` and `--color-bio-light` values.
- Removed dark mode media query from `app/globals.css` to enforce light mode.
- Updated `components/GenerativeArtBackground.tsx` and `components/GenerativeArtCard.tsx` to use light background color (`rgb(244, 251, 254)`).
- Updated `components/Footer.tsx` to explicitly use Dark Footer styling using Arbitrary Values to bypass variable confusion/conflicts.
    - Hardcoded Background to `#050e05` (Dark).
    - Hardcoded Text to `#f4fbfe` (Light) and its opacity variants.
- Reverted `components/FooterBackground.tsx` to Dark Mode settings to match the Footer container.
    - `renderer.setClearColor` back to `#050e05`.
    - Restored additive shader logic for glowing trails on dark background.

### TypeScript Fixes
- Installed `@types/p5` (v1.7.0) to provide proper type definitions for `p5` objects.
- Updated `components/GenerativeArtBackground.tsx` and `components/GenerativeArtCard.tsx`:
    - Imported `p5Types` from `p5`.
    - Replaced `any` type on `p5` parameters with `p5Types` to resolve linting errors and ensure type safety.
